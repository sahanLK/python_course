Special Sequences are predefined character classes or shorthand notations that simplify pattern writing.
They begin with a backslash(\) followed by a character and are used to match specific types of characters
 or positions in the text.

Note: COMBINING SPECIAL SEQUENCES WITH QUANTIFIES ALLOW YOU TO PERFORM REALLY POWERFUL PATTERN MATCHING.
